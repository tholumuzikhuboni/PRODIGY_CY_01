# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm, which is used to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting letters in the alphabet by a certain value. This project was developed as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship** at **Prodigy Info Tech**, where I explored encryption methods as a fundamental aspect of securing data.

## Overview

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number (known as the shift value). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the encryption and decryption process using this technique.

### Features

- **Encrypting Text**: Convert plaintext into ciphertext using a shift value.
- **Decrypting Text**: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext using the same shift value.
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface**: Users can interact with the program by providing the text and shift value for encryption or decryption.

## How It Works

- **Encryption**: Each letter in the input text is replaced by a letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- **Decryption**: The encrypted text is converted back to its original form using the reverse process, by shifting the letters back by the same value.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation
